nss-mdns (0.15.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
  * Update standards version to 4.6.0 (no changes needed)
  * Bump debhelper compat level from 12 to 13
    - debian/rules: Drop --fail-missing argument to dh_missing, which
      is now the default.
  * Remove Lintian overrides that are no longer needed
  * d/tests: Stop trying to exercise upgrades from jessie.
    This hasn't been supported since testing reopened after the stretch
    release in 2017.

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * d/salsa-ci.yml: Request standard CI on salsa.debian.org
  * Standards-Version: 4.5.0 (no changes required)

    heuristic
  * d/tests/remove-reinstall: When using proposed cross-autopkgtest
    infrastructure to test i386 packages in an amd64 testbed, act on the
    i386 package. Thanks, Steve Langasek (Closes: #946232)
  * d/tests: When using proposed cross-autopkgtest infrastructure,
    distinguish between testbed and host versions of nss-mdns and getent,
    and automatically use host architecture as secondary architecture
    for multiarch tests

nss-mdns (0.14.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Migrate Vcs-* from Alioth to salsa.debian.org
  * Change d/copyright Format to https URL
  * Use debhelper compat level 11
  * Remove explicit build-dependency on dh-autoreconf, no longer needed
  * Standards-Version: 4.1.4 (no further changes)
  * Override dh_missing instead of using deprecated
    dh_install --fail-missing
  * d/watch, d/copyright: Switch to new upstream developer
  * d/gbp.conf: Merge upstream git history into upstream/latest branch
  * New upstream release (Closes: #833952)
    - IPv6 scope IDs should now work (Closes: #644912)
    - Drop patch, applied upstream
    - d/libnss-mdns.docs: Update
    - d/copyright: Mention new maintainer
  * Remove build-dependency on lynx, no longer used
  * Add build-dependency on check
    - d/p/Make-tests-minimally-compatible-with-check-0.10.patch:
      Patch tests to work with Debian's 2015 version of check
      (workaround for #858823)
  * Remove --disable-legacy configure option, no longer needed
  * Explicitly enable build-time tests unless nocheck build profile
    was used
  * d/p/Update-README.md-to-be-clearer-about-mdns.allow.patch:
    Add post-release patch from upstream to clarify documentation
  * Build-depend on pkg-config for pkg.m4
  * Make multiarch autopkgtests more robust
    - Automatically skip multiarch autopkgtests if secondary architecture
      libc6 (libc6:i386 or libc6:armhf) cannot be installed. This will
      hopefully mean Ubuntu can stop patching this package to disable
      those tests.
    - Automatically skip multiarch autopkgtests if libnss-mdns cannot
      be installed for both the primary and secondary architectures
      due to multiarch skew.
  * Make sure autopkgtests have libnss-mdns available and are triggered
    by it

nss-mdns (0.10-8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/gbp.conf: use DEP-14 branch names (debian/master and
    upstream/latest)
  * Standards-Version: 3.9.8 (no changes needed)
  * libnss-mdns.postinst: remove special code to handle upgrades from
    ancient versions (all were older than squeeze)
  * libnss-mdns.postinst: configure libnss-mdns before libnss-resolve
    (mitigates: #846944, Closes: #851180)
  * libnss-mdns.postinst: shuffle libnss-mdns before libnss-resolve
    during upgrade if necessary
  * debian/tests: add autopkgtests for the interaction between
    libnss-mdns and libnss-resolve
  * debian/rules: enable bindnow hardening
  * Bump debhelper compat level to 10
    - do not explicitly use autoreconf, it is now the default
  * debian/rules: FTBFS if files are built but not installed
  * libnss-mdns.postrm: do not deconfigure the module until the
    package is purged (Closes: #500478, #782281, #782282)
    - debian/tests/nss-behaviour: verify that the glibc < 2.11 bug
      that caused #534304 has been fixed, so leaving unavailable
      NSS modules in /etc/nsswitch.conf is harmless
    - debian/tests: add autopkgtests for #500478, #782281, #782282

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Thu, 12 Jan 2017 22:11:47 +0000

nss-mdns (0.10-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add Vcs-Git, Vcs-Browser fields
  * Move the git repo to collab-maint; it is still a pkg-utopia
    package, but there seems little reason to make it more awkward
    for other developers to commit changes.
  * Remove transitional lib32nss-mdns and libnss-mdns-i386 packages.
    The transition took place in Debian 8 (jessie) and we do not support
    direct upgrades from pre-jessie to stretch.
  * This upload includes automatic debug symbols (Closes: #642026)
  * Standards-Version: 3.9.7 (no changes needed)
  * Normalize packaging via wrap-and-sort -abst

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Fri, 05 Feb 2016 11:21:05 +0000

nss-mdns (0.10-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bring back a transitional lib32nss-mdns on amd64. It depends on
    a new transitional libnss-mdns-i386 on i386, which in turn depends
    on libnss-mdns. This is necessary because a direct dependency
    on libnss-mdns:i386 by an amd64 package is not yet allowed:

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Wed, 15 Jan 2014 11:05:02 +0000

nss-mdns (0.10-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove transitional lib32nss-mdns for now, since it looks as though
    an automatic upgrade will need a second transitional package and
    a trip through the NEW queue
  * Override lintian warning for a ${source:Version}-based relation on
    lib32nss-mdns, which is not built from this package but will come back
    later
  * Override lintian warning for package-name-doesnt-match-sonames:
    the objects in this package are plugins, not normal libraries
  * Standards-Version: 3.9.5 (no changes needed)
  * Redo copyright file in DEP-5 format
  * Only remove nss-mdns from nsswitch.conf if no more instances
    are installed (Closes: #712029)
  * Release to unstable

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Wed, 15 Jan 2014 10:22:10 +0000

nss-mdns (0.10-4) experimental; urgency=low

  * Add myself to Uploaders
  * Acknowledge NMUs
  * Remove 00_dns_unaligned_access.patch, already applied upstream in 0.10
  * Convert to 3.0 (quilt) format, with 01_ia64_alignment.patch applied
    as a patch by dpkg
  * Bring debhelper compat up to 9
  * Use dpkg's default.mk for architecture and hardening flags
  * Use dh and dh_autoreconf
  * Make libnss-mdns Multi-arch: same (Closes: #686984, #710232)
  * Switch lib32nss-mdns from a biarch package built on amd64 to a
    transitional package built on i386: this means users of wheezy's
    multiarch Wine packages, who already have i386 as a foreign
    architecture, should automatically get cross-graded from
    lib32nss-mdns:amd64 to lib32nss-mdns:i386 and hence to libnss-mdns:i386
  * Simplify build system now that there is only one "flavour"
  * debian/control: remove duplicate Section
  * Standards-Version: 3.9.4 (no further changes)
  * Run dh_install with --list-missing
  * Add gbp.conf
  * Add debian/source/local-options to unapply patches when built from git
  * On new installations, do not add "mdns4" to nsswitch.conf, only
    "mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return]". This means we can't
    perform reverse DNS using mDNS for addresses outside 169.254.x.x and
    fe80::/10, but avoids a 5 second delay if such addresses do not
    have a PTR record in DNS (Closes: #412714, #414569, #561622 for
    new installations).
  * Document the alternative configuration with mdns4 in README.Debian

    (Closes: #580394, #603581)
  * Include a patch that fixes unaligned access on successful lookups on
    interesting 64-bit systems. (Closes: #521184)

nss-mdns (0.10-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Rework the build process completely to be able to build multiple flavors;
    build a "main" flavor and an addition "m32" flavor for amd64 which is
    installed in a new lib32nss-mdns package for 32-bits compatibility;
    build-depend on gcc-mutilib; initial patch proposed by Goswin von
    Brederlow; closes: #410052.

 -- Loic Minier <lool@dooz.org>  Mon, 02 Jul 2007 21:42:31 +0200

nss-mdns (0.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Set Utopia Maintenance Team as Maintainer and add Sjoerd and myself as
    Uploaders.
  * Ack NMU.
  * Bump Debhelper compatibility level to 5.
  * Misc cleanups.
  * Wrap fields in control.
  * Add ${misc:Depends}.
  * Switch to a multi-binaries layout for the packaging.
  * Split the definition of configure flags and LDFLAGS.
  * Drop -DNDEBUG=1 from CFLAGS; seems risky in a package build.
  * Only pass --host to configure if DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE and DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE
    differ.
  * Add watch file.

nss-mdns (0.9-0.2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload to fix a RC bug.
  * Configure with a prefix of / instead of /usr as libnss-mdns needs to be in
    /lib for the resolver to work correctly during boot; this is also needed
    for chrooted processes such as Postfix's smtpd which uses a copy of the
    NSS libs as well of the NSS configuration and fails when mdns is missing
    in the chroot but referenced in nsswitch.conf.  Update other configured
    dirs (mandir, infodir, sysconfdir) as well, but these are currently not
    used.

nss-mdns (0.9-0.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload to fix broken dependencies in the 0.8-6.1 NMU.
  * Fix Depends on perl and avahi-daemon.
  * Bump up dependency on avahi-daemon to >= 0.6.16-1 for the auto-disabling
    functionality on sites with a .local SOA.
  * New upstream release.
    - Does not export unnecessary symbols and fixes segfault in nmbclient
      which had symbols with the same name; closes: #404266.
    - Does not use the "search" keyword of resolv.conf anymore;
      closes: #404534, #405327.
  * Re-add a postrm to cleanup the mdns_* entries from nsswitch.conf but act on
    package removal instead of purge to avoid breaking the DNS when the lib is
    removed and to ensure perl is still present; closes: #406198.
  * Document the changes made to postinst in NOTES.Debian and document the
    history of the postrm as well.
  * Updates to README.Debian; add upstream URL for troubleshooting.

nss-mdns (0.8-6.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload to fix a long-standing RC bug and to beat the
    package into shape before etch with suggestions from upstream; thanks
    Lennart Poettering.
  * Configure with --disable-legacy, as recommended by upstream for security
    reasons; the legacy mode might be offered in a separate binary package for
    the corner cases where it can be useful; see full discussion in #393711;
    depend on avahi-daemon as nss-mdns will not work without avahi when
    compiled like this; closes: #399297.
  * Only suggest zeroconf instead of Recommending it: even if it can act as a
    nice complement to nss-mdns, it is intrusive and orthogonal to nss-mdns
    and conflicts with avahi-autoipd; closes: #353131, #392590.
  * Suggest avahi-autoipd as an alternative to zeroconf.
  * Remove offensive comments in postinst and README.Debian.
  * Document the history of postinst snippets in debian/NOTES.Debian to permit
    handling all upgrade paths.
  * Depend on Perl for the postinst snippets using the perl interpreter.
  * Rewrite postinst to handle all upgrade paths.
    - Does not wipe NSS configuration which matches the upstream recommended
      configuration during upgrades from versions 0.8-4.2 or 0.8-5;
      closes: #393608.
    - Install the upstream recommended configuration for first installs and
      upgrades from versions which did not automatically insert mdns in the
      NSS setup (unless mdns is already setup); closes: #393711.
    - Keep configuration intact when upgrading from versions which installed
      the upstream recommended configuration.
    - Remove whitespaces added in upgrades from version 0.8-4.2 or 0.8-5 to
      0.8-6.
    - For upgrades from 0.8-6, attempt to revert the problematic "mdns_minimal
      dns mdns" configuration and to install the upstream recommended
      configuration.
  * Update README.Debian to match the above changes and a planned changes in
    avahi-daemon which should disable itself if a .local SOA is found after a
    change in the DNS settings.

  * "Unbreak the world" (Closes: #392813)

  "So whether nss-mdns does or doesn't support "search local" is of no
  concern to me -- I just doesn't want it to interfere with my otherwise
  working setup."

    Walter Hofmann on Joey Hess and Sjoerd Simons' period of maintainence

  * Revert switch to CDBS.
  * Switch to using a sane /etc/nsswitch.conf
    so we don't break existing setups, or those over which the user has
    no control.
  * Revert "clarifications" as well.
  * Recommend, once again, zeroconf.

  * Add postrm to remove mdns entries from /etc/nsswitch.conf when the package
    is removed.
  * Local modifications to the file will be preserved accross upgrades.
  * Depend on base-files 3.1.10 or higher to get a nsswitch.conf that is not a
    conffile and that doesn't have mdns entries from base-files in it.
  * Switch to nsswitch line recommended by upstream in #388864 after getting
    clarification from upstream, and update README.Debian.
  * Remove recommends on zeroconf. Closes: #353131
